"David Cockayne comes from the formerly industrial West Midlands of England. He left school at 16 and became a gas fitter, subsequently declining into technical writing and then English teaching. Somewhere along the line he aquired qualifications in Computer Science and Linguistics.

His interest in Chinese philosophy derives from a youthful dalliance with Maoism during the Cultural Revolution and, in more recent times, two years' confusion while teaching in Beijing. He is presently attempting to write an introduction to what Confucianism is, and is not, focussing especially on what the ancient texts themselves actually say."
